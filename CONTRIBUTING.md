# Contribution guide

All development is done through a process using [issues](https://github.com/ioprodz/ioprodz/issues) on this repositories.

## How issues are created

### New features

Changes to introduce new features, alter architecture and in general have large impact on the code base are pre-qualified in the [project managment tools](https://github.com/orgs/ioprodz/projects/3/views/2) of ioprodz, They pass different stages of :

- Idea: this is where intentions to change the platform land. The idea owner should write a proposal that can be discussed by community members.
- Challenge: Discussion between owner and other dev community members to qualify the idea to a product feature.
- Spec: Here where the functional and technical aspects of how to implement the feature will be written.
- Priorities: Here means the feature is ready to be worked on code-wise, and it will be picked by a delivery owner (can be other than the idea owner), At this stage an issue will be created on the repository and can be picked up to delivery
- Delivery: In this stage the issue is being handled by a developer or more.

### Bugs

Issues can be created according to defects found in the platform and will be treated in the normal delivery process.

- checkout the branch locally and work on it
